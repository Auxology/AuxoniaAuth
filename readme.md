# üîê Learning Authentication System Development
A detailed example of building a modern authentication system.
Current example only includes typescript as backend and frontend language.
More languages will be added in the future.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project is currently pending a major rewrite to improve architecture and implement better practices.
